# Web simulation of Fedora Workstation

This is a personal portfolio website themed after Fedora Workstation (GNOME), made using Next.js & tailwind CSS.
If you want to edit this. Clone this project and edit the files in `/src/components`.

## Theming

The palette lives in `tailwind.config.js`. Accent colours come from the Fedora brand
(Fedora Blue `#3C6EB4`, Dark Blue `#294172`, Light Blue `#51A2DA`); neutrals and status
colours come from GNOME Adwaita. Tokens are prefixed `fd-` (backgrounds), `fdt-` (text)
and `fdb-` (borders). Icons live in `public/themes/Adwaita/`.

### Asset licensing
